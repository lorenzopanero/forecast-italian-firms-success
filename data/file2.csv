Distribution started for real in 2001 when, following approval of law 405 of 16 November of that year, pharmacists became obliged to provide an equivalent medicine with the lowest price amongst those available on the normal regional distributive network, whenever a doctor prescribes a medicine without specifying that it is not to be substituted.  Between 1996 and 2001 DOC Generici laid down the managerial, organizational and manufacturing foundations that enabled it to be among the first to enter the equivalent medicines market. On July 1st 2013 DOC Generici was acquired by Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP, a British Private Equity Fund and one of Europe's leading Private Equity Firms. This is the first investment in Italy by this large and historical Fund.

Erydel,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/erydel,"Based in Urbino, EryDel has developed and patented a technology for drug delivery of pharmacological agents through erythrocytes (red blood cells). This process allow to easily load red blood cells with drugs, proteins, contrasting agents for diagnostic purposes, nanoparticles etc. that can be progressively released into the patient body thus allowing an increased efficacy of the therapy and a reduction of collateral effects.

Gervasoni SpA,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gervasoni-spa,"Gervasoni SpA is an Italian furniture designer and manufacturer. Founded in 1882, the company is currently managed by the third generation of the family with Giovanni and Michele Gervasoni. The aesthetic standards and production techniques have changed over the years. Not the passion for beauty and artfully made. Attention to detail, the use of natural materials crafted with mastery, suggestions of places near and far remain the hallmarks of Gervasoni products. The company designs, develops, manufactures and markets furniture solutions for the home and for the contract sector in its production facility of 40000 sq. m in Pavia di Udine, that has 90 employees. Collaboration with some of the most qualified designers such as Paola Navone – artistic director of the company – Marco Piva, Michael Sodeau and Jasper Startup, guarantees the aesthetic quality of the products and continued experimentation with new materials. Today the Gervasoni Company is a broad and qualified reality. Following the family's entrepreneurial vocation, in 2009 Giovanni and Michele Gervasoni acquired IFA srl – a company specialised in the production of high quality wooden chairs – launching the brand Very Wood reserved for the contract market. In 2012 Gervasoni presented Letti&co., its new brand dedicated to the culture of sleep, born from the collaboration with Paola Navone, artistic director also of the new brand.

TerniEnergia S.p.A.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ternienergia-s-p-a,"Italeaf has a 54.84 % shareholding in TerniEnergia, an Italian company operating in the renewable energy sector and the PV field. It is listed on the STAR segment of Mercato Telematico Azionario, the main Italian regulated securities market, organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. TerniEnergia operates as a system integrator, with a turn-key offer of industrial sized PV plants for power generation, on its own and on behalf of third parties, including joint ventures with leading national companies. TerniEnergia also operates in the waste management sector, where it is engaged in the recovery of material and energy, and in the development and production of technologies. In particular, TerniEnergia is active in the recovery of used tyres, the treatment of biodegradable waste through the implementation of bio-digesters, the management of a plant for biological depuration, the decommissioning of industrial plants, the recovery of demolition metals and cleaning of industrial sites; and the development and production of technological apparatus. TerniEnergia, through its subsidiary Lucos Alternative Energies, operates in the development of energy efficient plants, both through an EPC (Energy Performance Contracting) scheme and FTT scheme (Financing Through Third Parties). Its objectives are to increase energy production from renewable sources, save energy and reduce omissions as outlined in the European environmental policy.  TerniEnergia has set a strategy for the future with the following lines of development: -	INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: In 2014/2015, construction for a leading European utility company of two PV plants in South Africa for an amount of approximately EUR 140 million is planned. In the short term TerniEnergia also plans to establish a company in a joint venture with Al Hamed Group, named TerniEnergia Gulf LLC, headquartered in Abu Dhabi, whose share capital shall be divided as follows: a majority stake of 51 % to be owned by Al Hamed Group and 49 % by Italeaf. The company will operate in the fields of power generation, waste to energy and waste management. By 2014 TerniEnergia expects to open the first sites and start the construction of a plant for the recovery of used tyres in the Middle East. -	ITALIAN DEVELOPMENT: There is great potential in the growing sectors of smart energy and energy efficiency. In particular, the company has started negotiations for the acquisition of Free Energia S.p.A. A successful acquisition will, thanks to the sales network of Free Energia, allow for a completion of the downstream value chain for power generation plants owned by TerniEnergia. In addition, [TerniEnergia has acquired all the remaining outstanding shares of its portfolio company Lucos Alternative Energies in July 2014. The two operational investments will jointly allow for strong potential synergies and opportunities for the integration of the businesses, which will be the basis for a strong growth in energy efficiency and enhancement of energy production from renewable sources.] TerniEnergia will also continue strengthening its portfolio of environmental assets, completing a new facility for the treatment and recovery of ""secondary raw material"" of used tyres in Northern Italy and utilising a new plant in Southern Italy for energy recovery through anaerobic biodigestion and composting. Finally, the new plant for the treatment of industrial waste fluids in Nera Montoro, is as of [the day of this Company Description] in an advanced authorisation phase. Once completed, it will intercept a substantial demand in a market segment with high technological content and high growth prospects. -	STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT: TerniEnergia will focus on business lines with major developments. Concentration will be on power generation with full technological independence by diversifying the sources and technologies available. By doing this TerniEnergia enhances its opportunities in the short term and has the flexibility to meet changing demands in the future. TerniEnergia intends to have a balanced portfolio for each country in the process of internationalisation of PV, EPC and environmental business. In particular, TerniEnergia continues to undertake intensive scouting activities to promote development projects in the most attractive countries for the installation of large-scale plants within the sectors PV, biomass, biogas and energy recovery from waste. On the financial side, TerniEnergia intends to strengthen its excellent reputation with investors through its presence on the Italian Stock Exchange, in order to become a candidate for an investment platform for institutional investors. TerniEnergia wants to do this by creating the right conditions, through the stability of cash flows and using debt in an efficient manner with respect to changes in the demand of the market.",http://www.ternienergia.com,Waste Management,"Narni, Umbria, Italy","TerniEnergia, part of Italeaf Group, is listed on Borsa Italiana and operates in renewable energy, energy efficiency and waste management","3,221,876",2005-09-01,day,51-100,683,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",5035,,Active,2008-08-01,day,,,For Profit,http://twitter.com/TerniEnergia,,,,+39 0744.758.205,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sustainability,,,,M&A,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STALAM S.p.A.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stalam-s-p-a,"Established in 1978, STALAM is a world leader in the development, design and manufacture of radio frequency (RF) equipment for the drying and thermal processing of raw materials, intermediate and finished industrial products. The drying of textile fibres and yarns, technical textiles and related products (glass fibres, polymeric foams, non-wovens, etc.) is the best known and most widespread application of STALAM’s radio frequency technology. STALAM’s RF equipment are also being applied successfully since the late eighties to the post-baking drying of a wide range of bakery products. Many other innovative applications of the radio frequency technology in the food industry were introduced for the first time on a truly industrial scale by STALAM in the last decade, like the quick defrosting of frozen fish, meat and other raw or processed food products, the pasteurisation and sterilisation of either solid packaged food or viscous liquid products in the tube, the baking of white-crust bread, the disinfestation and sanitisation of dry food commodities (grains, seeds, legumes, etc.). Lately, STALAM has undertaken an ambitious business development programme, involving the diversification into other innovative, non-conventional drying and thermal processes, which also include the microwave (MW) and infrared (IR) technologies. In this context, STALAM collaborates actively with prestigious universities, research institutes and engineering firms. STALAM is a member of CONFINDUSTRIA (the General Confederation of the Italian Industry), of ACIMIT (the Association of Italian Manufacturers of Machinery for the Textile Industry), and has established long-term co-operations with leading European machinery manufacturers for the development of innovative industrial processing technologies and for the supply of turn-key automated and integrated production lines. STALAM presently offers the widest and most advanced range of industrial radio frequency drying and thermal processing equipment, which enable their users to obtain the maximum benefits from the RF technology in terms of quality of the finished products, reduced operating costs, high flexibility and reliability. Presently, more than 1,800 STALAM machines are in operation in more than 50 countries, having rated output power values ranging from 3 to 450 kW; from the simple, manually operated machine, to the fully automated line complete with computerised control and supervision systems. Exporting more than 95% of its products to the five continents, STALAM provides professional and prompt commercial and technical assistance in all relevant industrial areas throughout the world, thanks to its well structured sales and servicing organisation. In pursuance of its global market approach, in 2005 STALAM has established a subsidiary in China, to exploit more effectively the opportunities offered by the fast growing Far Eastern economies.",http://www.stalam.com,"Machinery Manufacturing, Manufacturing","Nove, Veneto, Italy","STALAM S.p.A is a world leader in the development, design and manufacture of radio frequency (RF) equipment for the drying.","1,561,885",1978-01-01,year,101-250,266,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",36055,,Active,2017-01-27,day,,,For Profit,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2545556/,stalam@stalam.com,+39 0424 597400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manufacturing,,,,M&A,,,,,,"Engineering, Operations, Sales",4,,,-95.47%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spedingo.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spedingo-com,"Spedingo.com is the Italian eco-friendly delivery marketplace. Launched in 2012, the service matches people needing to move goods with transport and moving companies ""going there anyway"". The marketplace allows consumers and businesses to save up to 70% on deliveries of large boxes, household goods, cars, bikes, palletised industrial goods and any other large item. The idea underlying Spedingo’s success is simple: over 25% of lorries run completely empty of cargo and over 50% run only part-full.

Il Ponte Pelletteria S.p.a - The Bridge,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/il-ponte-pelletteria-s-p-a-the-bridge,"II Ponte Pelletteria S.p.A. was established in 1969 in Scandicci, then just a small town at the gates of Florence. Founded by five partners, the company has always distinguished itself in the production of bags and accessories with a characteristic style. From the great artisan workshop on the outskirts of Florence, high-quality products were produced with fine materials and unique processes. The value of “Made in Italy” – the typical workmanship of the Florentine bottega – was combined with an aesthetic sense that is definitely “English”. Thus emerged an Anglo-Tuscan style which would serve as an inspiration to many in the later years. Leather was the undisputed protagonist in the collections of those early years, marketed under the trademark of The Bridge using only full-grain leather of national origin. The best leather is worked according to the most stringent craftsmanship techniques, starting from the tanning stage through dyeing and polishing with amber rollers. The result is leather that is soft and elastic. Its vivid, brilliant appearance acquires, with the passing of time, that lived-in and unmistakable charm. This is a characteristic of all the products of The Bridge. In 1987, we moved to the actual plants in the productive district of Scandicci. Thus, the firm evolved from a large artisan workshop into a true manufacturing company. From that moment onwards, the company came to assume ever greater importance for the economic fabric of the province and the region itself. Today the company continues its production of leather accessories, but it has also enhanced the offering with different materials, such as canvas, coated embossed fabric and high-tech fabrics.",http://thebridge.it/,"Fashion, Manufacturing, Textiles","Firenze, Toscana, Italy",Il Ponte Pelletteria S.p.a - The Bridge provides production of bags and accessories with a characteristic style.,"281,882",1969-01-01,year,101-250,"52,773","European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",50018,,Active,2016-11-10,day,,,For Profit,https://twitter.com/TheBridgeItaly,https://www.facebook.com/pg/TheBridgeItaly/about/?ref=page_internal,https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-bridge_6,customerservice@thebridge.it,+39 055 7350654,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clothing and Apparel, Design, Manufacturing",,,,M&A,,,,,,Finance,3,,"96,854.17",-50.21%,$10M to $50M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
