Why viteSicure In Italy, 48% of families do not save, 61% suffer from anxiety about the economic future of the family and only 6% have life protection insurance. This is called Protection GAP (difference between resources needed and available at the death of the head of the family) and is a worldwide problem while companies are still focused on offering savings products, not aligned with the new buying habits of customers, with complicated and old processes, ignoring the millions of financially vulnerable customers. Customers are online, reacting to advertising and using technology and so we believed that digital transformation was the solution to engage customers, educate them about the insurance solution, reduce the distance to insurance and meet the demands and needs immediately. Technology is our enabler for reaching the financially vulnerable. Our open API platform enables fully digital processes not only with insurance companies as is the case with most digital brokers but across the entire value chain thus enabling full transformation and integration of processes.

Through innovative social media campaigns and a booking platform, we raise awareness among young people, encouraging them to book donations at nearby centers and providing instant chat access with hematologists to address their concerns. For companies, we offer a welfare service and sustainability membership that engages employees in health prevention and blood donation. We organize awareness webinars, donation days, and monitor employee health, providing impact reports. These activities are included in the company's sustainability report and contribute to B-Corp certification. Our third pillar involves management software for hospitals. We offer a plugin that optimizes blood stock management in hospitals by managing donor portfolios and the relationships between donors, associations, and hospitals. By knowing the blood stock levels, we can send automatic recalls or alerts when blood is needed and there are donors nearby ready to donate.

We have made an important innovation in production and in distribution that allows the jeweler to be the protagonist inside of their business and to have a very important saving compared to traditional purchase channels for precious jewels. If you are a jeweler, thanks to our platform you can create a jewel precious to your brand by choosing from over 100,000 unique items by customizing each detail according to your needs. The jewels are 100% made in Italy, in Valenza, by the same craftsmen who usually work as subcontractors for the brands mentioned in the jeweler is a dealer. These subcontractors are managed with a technological system and innovative that allows the traceability of orders and raw materials on time real. Personalization of the jewel by choosing model, size, type, and quality of the stones, type, and weight of the chain, size of the butterflies. The engraving of your brand will allow you to make your collection unique. High-tech platform that independently manages production through the various subcontractors, checking the progress in real time up to internal quality control. The platform is a system that allows the jeweler to create a line of jewelry under its own brand to retain its customer by playing the role of jeweler and not dealer. Thanks to the disintermediation of realized processes with the platform the value for money is on average cheaper 30% above normal market prices. 97% of jewelers re-direct the credibility that their client recognizes towards a precious jewel branded with a label not known by the consumer and suggested by the jeweler himself. This label affixed by a distributor who had the jewel made by various subcontractors cannot be called a brand because: - Does not make models with identifiable design; - Does not carry out marketing operations to convey the consumer to jewelry. 80% of the precious jewels sold have a classic design and are not purchased for the brand they report. Become a protagonist in your jewelry, retain your customer, increase your margins and offer a better value for money We offer the possibility of being a partner in our start-up to a maximum of 100 jewelers.

The system was created to solve the cleaning problem in urban contexts directly through the city. Indeed, the mobile robots are little autonomous sweepers, which are able to get around the surroundings whilst collecting waste and avoiding obstacles, both static and dynamic, to then dock inside the bench and be charged thanks to solar energy.  Our aim is to develop an urban space which takes advantage of IoT devices, scattered around the city, to constantly sense and respond to the environment, while collecting useful data that will improve the management of the entire urban realm.  Pixies’s strength is its bottom-up approach to the problem of cleaning within cities, which ensures a very high level of efficiency, since it is a 24/7 on site, quick and sustainable solution. Moreover, thanks to the presence of the smart benches, we will have fixed charging stations directly installed around the city, thus giving a new piece of urban furniture, useful both for the environment and for the citizens. It's important to point out that the implementation of Pixies for cleaning purposes is only the beginning. Please, bear in mind that this system can be used within cities for a thousand other applications (delivery, first aid, mobile charging for vehicles, etc.), always remaining bottom-up, efficient and sustainable because it is embedded with the urban space. The competitive advantage of Pixies is its bottom-up approach to the problem of cleaning. Indeed, Pixies integrates the robots directly into the city, through the use of smart benches as charging bases for them. So far, Pixies has installed the prototype of the robot and the smart bench in the courtyard of the mixed-use building ( residential, hotel and offices) where the company is based, here in Rome, making it active and supervised by ourselves every day.  The system works perfectly. It's able to operate up to 8 hours per day, covering an area of 2'000 sqm, both indoor (300 sqm) and outdoor (1'700 sqm).  As results, the cleaning efficiency has been increased of about 30% and the related cost has been, therefore, reduced of about 40%. Our closest competitors are : Trombia, Enway, Idriverplus, TSM. However, we can also add to these other companies that have developed solutions for the autonomous indoor cleaning.

It is a tool that allows every executive and operations manager to check, at a glance, the results of online sales in relation to the expected objectives for the period.  It can be installed and configured in just a few minutes without the need for any specific technical skills. Thanks to intuitive dashboards, it shows in real-time the results of visits and sales that the online shop is producing. In addition, with special indicators, you can see at a glance whether performance is good or bad. Slymetrix Analytics also offers the possibility of displaying dashboards in 16:9 so that they can be transmitted live on a TV monitor: if placed in your office, it allows you to quickly check the real-time performance throughout the day. In addition, the advanced versions allow the definition of advertising campaigns in the various digital media channels, building an inventory of channels organized by traffic providers. Once the definition is complete, for each channel of each campaign the platform generates a tracking url, through which it will be possible to monitor the performance of the campaigns and those of the digital media channels.  In conclusion, with Slymetrix Analytics every e-commerce retailer can boost its performance by optimizing its media investment by monitoring results according to budget forecasts. Why investing: Because Slymetrix is the key tool to enable e-commerce to improve its performance and thus achieve the expected economic goals (increase sales and profit by at least 30%).

The company boasts a large and solid structure, based on the Open Innovation model, which currently has six people in the internal team, each of whom is responsible for a key area for the evolution of the project, who coordinate a total of twenty external collaborators.  Its operational HQ is located in Lomazzo, at the ComoNExT Scientific Technological Park, to which iUP got access after winning the ""Business Incubator 2018"" tender, promoted by the Chamber of Commerce of Como and by ComoNExT itself, emerging as the best startup among dozens of participants.  iUP is focused on the development of 2REC, an application designed to revolutionize the approach to voice messages and, more generally, to bring audio communication between people to a more advanced stage - an ambitious project that has allowed it to obtain numerous awards and is offering the company the opportunity to follow a significant path of internationalization.  For example, it has passed the selections for the ""Global Startup Program"" twice in a row; this is an initiative of the MISE promoted on the national territory. In 2019, this allowed it to participate in a three-month acceleration path in Silicon Valley at the Plug & Play Tech Center headquarters, one of the most renowned accelerator hubs in the world, while next summer, it allowed it to access the ""International ScaleUp"" program, also in the United States, at the ""Mind The Bridge"" accelerator in Los Angeles.  At the same time, ICE (the Agency for the promotion of Italian companies abroad) has called iUP twice to represent Italian tech innovation at the ""Mobile World Congress"" in Barcelona, the most prestigious mobile sector event in the world. After the 2020 presentation (unfortunately canceled following the Coronavirus emergency), it will participate in the 2021 iteration next June. Also, in collaboration with the ICE, iUP recently took part in the GITEX Future Stars in Dubai, the main technology event in the Middle East, and at the latest summit (this year in virtual form) of CES in Las Vegas, the most important digital-tech fair in the world during which the giants of the sector present their leading products.

Our platform integrates purpose-built experimental protocols, proprietary datasets and advanced design algorithms to accelerate product design and development, from personalized cell therapies to precision fermentation. Officinae Bio comes from the Latin word officinae meaning “the shop where things are designed and manufactured”. Our name reflects our mission to become the leading platform for biology design and build.  What are we building? We’re working to overcome the greatest challenges to a future built with biology; starting with the DNA at the core of all biological engineering. Vulcanus - automated pipelines for long and complex DNA constructs Vulcanus is the first AI-driven pipeline to automate the entire process of building large and complex DNA; from oligo design to fragment assembly. Vulcanus is capable of designing optimal protocols for the build of long and complex DNA constructs up to 50kbp at a 93% success rate - nearly double the success rate of industry standard in time frames that make possible rapid development and screening cycles. Named after the latin god of the forge. Vulcanus was believed to have built the most sophisticated items of ancient lore, including Jupiter’s lightning bolts and Mercury’s winged helm. Ulysses - navigate biological complexity to design superior products Having mastered DNA build, we are developing solutions to the next bottleneck to building with Biology: design.  Our Ulysses algorithm is enabling the smart navigation of complex option spaces when designing biological systems such as cell lines and strains. Ulysses leverages approaches for the design of the whole system rather than engineering individual parts. By recognizing the interconnectivity of all parameters and their nonlinear interactions of the system it allows for more robust, scaleable biological production and designs. Ulysses was the legendary Greek hero and king of Ithaca. His most famous journey was his ten-year struggle to return home through challenges and obstacles but he cleverly navigated through them with his wit and intellect.

Walle’s mission is to revolutionize urban and interurban mobility in the next 10 years, operating within the UAM (Urban Air Mobility) market, in strong worldwide expansion. Walle’s mission is to eliminate traffic and allow movements first interurban and then urban avoiding hours and hours of traffic from the city. We want to start with Milan. Milan is one of the most mature cities in Europe as sharing mobility. From 2004 until today, Milan Municipality signed agreements with seven car-sharing operators, eight scooter-sharing operators, and three bike-sharing operators. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is going to be a real opportunity and we would like to launch the service during Milano – Cortina 2026 Winter Olympic Games. Air Mobility would be the best solution to smartly move both athletes and wealthy travelers between different areas of cities. AIR - Since the beginning, our goal has been connecting ground-to-air with a click: so-called “taxi drones” have been included in our project. Nowadays UAM is just a project, an idea, and taxi drone services seem to be only a product of an SCI-FI writer but, then: why are we considering it? As said above, UAM offers incredible potential and a revolutionary scenario of travel between cities and suburbs. People&#39;s minds will soon be ready, authorities are working towards it, manufacturers are building, testing and certifying their aircraft while Walle is… already there. We want to be one of the first UAM service providers in the world because we strongly believe that this method of transportation, will allow both passengers and goods to travel very quickly through the cities with a fraction of relative costs. As part of the business model, we will be also renting the facilities like vertiports to other operators that will come afterward. By 2050 we will be ten billion on Earth! Of these 10 billion, almost seven billion will live in urban centers. Imagine the cities of the future. Imagine the links between regional cities and imagine the traffic!

It takes just a couple of minutes to process and send to the 3D printer any CT scan, cone beam or intra-oral scan.  Oral3D models improve dentist-patient communication, which is associated with more accurate diagnosis, better commitment of the patient during the treatment, improved outcomes, and less likelihood of complaints or litigation. In addition, the models support treatment planning and surgical rehearsals, favoring greater efficiency and accuracy.  The use of 3D printing models in dental offices is nowadays crucial in the communication between patients and dentists, making the planning of the treatment easier and increasing the satisfaction. Also the use of the model makes it easier for the dentist to plan the intervention, avoiding to directly plan it in the patient's mouth and decreasing discomfort. Last but not least, the 3D models can be very useful in seminars and lessons, where normally are used standardised models that don't really reflect a real patient's situation. Oral3D offers a unique solution, made by 3D printer and software, the only one existing capable of directly translating a CT Scan into a STL file, ready to print. Normally it takes technical help, money and time for a dentist to translate a CT Scan into a printable model, Oral3D's software does it automatically in a few minutes.",+39 3293638728,info@oral3d.eu,https://www.linkedin.com/company/oral3d/,https://www.oral3d.eu/en/,,,,,2019-07-07,day,Active,3D Printing for dentists,,,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",
