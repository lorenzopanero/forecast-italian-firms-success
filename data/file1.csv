BuskerLabel,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/buskerlabel,"BuskerLabel is a crowdfunding platform to finance and distribute free music under Creative Commons license. BuskerLabel innovates the music business focusing on the excitement during the period preceding an album's release. Once tracks are out, nobody can stop the digital media from being copied and shared, but before the release date getting access to music is a privilege of great value. As most of the major labels complain, releasing music in digital form is a critical moment since it starts a huge wave of downloading and sharing activity.  Licensing under Creative Commons allows music lovers to share tracks legally, while giving money to get early access to music gives them the status of co-producers and satisfies their curiosity.  BuskerLabel blends these two factors aiming to turn former copyright violators–so called ""pirates""–into True Fans. The model goes beyond simple donations for music that is already available for free; it also excludes the launch of project funding before going in the recording studio.  Music lovers visiting BuskerLabel listen to promo tracks and then, acting as talent scouts, satisfy their curiosity by paying a few Koins to get early access to the new album in its entirety. The Koin is the currency internal to BuskerLabel with a value of 1 Euro each, and can be purchased conveniently using PayPal or a credit card. BuskerLabel passes on to the artists 80% of the collected money right after the release date! Any artist is now able to quickly get money from their True Fans, with the simple action of uploading tracks, choosing a release date, and starting the collecting phase.  Listening to the freely available promo tracks, fans choose if it is worth to pay one or more Koins, and if they do, they can immediately play back the entire album, and recommend it to friends through their usual social networks. After the chosen date, the album is released under a Creative Commons license allowing all Internet users to freely download and share tracks for personal use. Creative Commons licenses allow to maximize the legal music diffusion by bringing more and more fans to the artist for subsequent releases and, most importantly, for live tours that depend mostly on the “brand awareness“ of the artist's name.",http://www.buskerlabel.com,"Crowdfunding, Music, Non Profit","Roma, Lazio, Italy",Crowdfunding for music releases.,"3,421,109",2009-01-01,year,1-10,,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",195,,Closed,,,,none,For Profit,http://twitter.com/buskerlabel,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/giuliodeluise,company@buskerlabel.com,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Financial Services, Media and Entertainment, Music and Audio, Other, Social Impact",3,"Giovanni Conte, Giulio De Luise, Pancrazio Auteri",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consigliamidove.it,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/consigliamidove-it,"With the success of Secret Salons in the UK, Web Development and SEO Agency Orchid Box is helping to launch a new service for the Italian market. The innovative website uses data from Facebook Places and an array of other sources to provide a useful service for the Italian market. ConsigliamiDove.it translates to “suggest me where“ and consists of user generated reviews of events, restaurants, place recommendations for any type of business and services in the Italian market. With so much to see and do in Italy, the website aims to be the first point of call for anyone who for example is looking for bars in Rome or a solicitor in Naples. The service is absolutely free for business to advertise on and for consumers to write and read reviews about services and products. Users do not need to be registered to write a review, although the website is monitored by the site administrators. The idea is simple, to have reviews on business and services, for example, if someone recommended a dentist, the user can use the Consigliami Dove website to see what other people are saying about the practice. Alternatively if a user is looking to go to a restaurant in Milan, they can use the website to find and review the restaurant. Qype, the Yelp of Europe, is the only site to offer a similar service in Italy, they have raised 3.5 million euros from Vodafone Ventures and a further 3.0 million euros from its existing three investors, Advent Venture Partners, Partech International and Wellington Partners. Launched in 2006, Qype allows users to browse and add reviews for restaurants, hotels, bars and other establishments. Consigliami Dove isn’t currently looking for funding but advertisers are welcome to enquire about advertising on the site. ConsigliamiDove.it currently has over 200,000 Italian businesses on its database and aims to reach 500,000 by January 2011.

EveryWare Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/everyware-technologies,"Everyware Technologies is a spin-off of the University of Milan and wants to become a leader in developing mobile computing solutions by offering location-based services and by preserving, at the same time, users’ privacy in terms of position and displacements.  The first app for mobile devices that uses this technology, as a result of more than 3 years of researches about privacy concerning topics, is PCube (http://pcube.everywaretechnologies.com), available both for iPhone and Android platforms. PCube notifies to the user his friends’ geographic proximity, without releasing to the server any information about his position and allowing, at the same time, to control the precision of the information given to the other users, thanks to a Google Maps interface. It is possible to protect users’ privacy and identity thanks to cryptography, anonymisation and spatial-temporal generalization techniques that allow clouding the data sent to the server. In the near future will be also provided a lot of other services, such as: •	Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare integration with also the chance to post on each one of these social networks •	Chat system and Let’s Meet system with the possibility to talk and plan a meeting with the other users •	Social gaming based on a rewarding system with virtual money The solution we offer has exclusive skills as compared to the competitors (location sharing and geographical proximity services such as Google Latitude, Facebook Places and Foursquare).  For example thanks to Google Latitude it is possible to see the geographical position of a user and be notified if a friend is in proximity (the same of PCube), but this service acquires position data and doesn’t offer a clear control of the precision used by someone in acquiring the position of some other.  Similarly, Facebook Places and Foursquare only offer narrow privacy control to the users and acquire position data (the so called check-in) on their servers with the goal of free sharing between the users and to convey location-based promotions. There is only another app that offers a service based on an effective privacy control system. Its name is Locaccino and it comes from years of researches by a spin-off of Carnegie Mellon University. It allows indicating exactly some areas in which the geographic position can be released, with the possibility to specify when this information is accessible. PCube Technology offers the same functions without delivering to the server any information about the other users’ position. Because of this innovative skills and deployment prospects, one of the main goals is to implement an international patent. Other advantages of EveryWare Technology, that also represent sources of company’s differentiation over a long period of time, are: •	The owning of high technical competences and the ability to quickly acquire new ones, in order to preserve competitiveness in a changing environment. •	The possibility to have the access to a lot of innovative ideas due to the active members’ participation to international research activities.  •	The availability of apps prototypes already realized thanks to scientific research in privacy management field •	Privileged access channels with companies and institutions thanks to the relationships network of the University of Milan.",http://pcube.everywaretechnologies.com,"Internet, Location Based Services, Mobile, Privacy","Milan, Lombardia, Italy","Mobile, App, Privacy, Social Network","2,870,855",2011-01-14,day,1-10,,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",20134,,Closed,,,2019-01-01,year,For Profit,http://twitter.com/ewtechprivacy,http://www.facebook.com/ewtech,,info@everywaretechnologies.com,(+39)0250316219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Mobile, Navigation and Mapping, Privacy and Security",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Less than $1M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Users can share their computer's spare computational power through our shared computing system. In this way they get free forecasts and contribute to the MarketMind system. There's no need to install or download anything: all computation is performed via browser.  By using our user's computing power as well, MarketMind can generate an analysis capacity wiyhout precedents. Technology MarketMind is based on HABITAT: a resident virtual ecosystem on our servers where thousands of neural networks forecast market fluctuations. HABITAT applies the law of evolution: only the best neural networks survive and are used to generate financial forecasts. Darwinian natural selection allows the populations of neural networks in the HABITAT to evolve continuously improving their ability to predict the stock markets. This allows different populations of neural networks to coexist and compete within HABITAT, each characterised by different prediction strategies. Every day, under the constant supervision of our systems, new evolution lines arise and others expire in a continuous process of improvement towards more accurate and reliable forecasts. Our control systems constantly monitor the populations and lineages present in HABITAT and, using the best experts, they get the financial forecasts that we deliver to users every day.",http://www.market-mind.net,Finance,"Milan, Lombardia, Italy",MarketMind Research is a Italy based technology advisory company.,"3,094,180",2012-01-01,year,1-10,,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,Closed,,,,none,For Profit,https://www.twitter.com/marketmind_it,https://www.facebook.com/marketmindresearch,https://www.linkedin.com/company/marketmind-research,informazioni@market-mind.net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Financial Services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,$1M to $10M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The noble cuisine of the court of Savoy, and those from the peasant tradition. The cuisine of the court has very rich dishes that were served in the sumptuous banquets of the court such as chocolate, Zabaione, Mixed Bollito and Piemonte Fried Mixed. The peasant cuisine has recipes made with simple ingredients such as panissa, Bagna Cauda, Finanziera. Finest wine pairing. Piemonte wines are very famous all around the world. We have a very ancient history of winemakers, vines and grapes. In Piemonte each food has its wine to be paired with. It’s a culture, it’s a lifestyle, it’s a tradition. We ever taste food with specific wine, we love to taste different pairings and enjoy the combined flavors. 2 Healthy recipes High variety of ingredients, many vegetables, few meat and fats. Meat was consumed just in few occasions. We can say that Piemonte cuisine is mostly, in its everyday shape, a vegetarian cuisine. Eggs, milk and butter were used to fill the dish in the past, whilst meat was used only in special occasions like holidays and sundays. Moreover our granny were used to cook small farm animals like chicken, rabbit, quail, rather than the big cattle. 3 Easy recipes A friendly way of cooking The traditional Piemonte recipes have born in a time when cooking was made while women were doing other things. Therefore recipes must be easy to prepare, with quick and few steps, and short time of cooking. It is a very modern cuisine. 3 Things I do to simplify recipes To make Piemonte recipes really feasible for a worldwide home cooking I adapt every recipe. Behind each recipe there’s a whole world of research and study to let you taste the original flavor that you would love to experience if you be right here. I adapt ingredients, ease procedures and take procedure pictures. 1 Adapt Ingredients International substitute for the regional ingredients Each and every ingredient must be available in your countries. I’m very selective in researching the right ingredients that could fit the recipes instead of the local ones, because they must preserve the original flavor of the recipes. At the end of selection and testing the smell and flavor must be delicious, unique and original. International Ingredients measures Ingredients measures are provided converted. You find cups and ounces instead of milliliters and grams. You find also an Ingredient converter, just in case. 2 Ease Procedures I simplify procedures, appliances and timing of each recipe For every recipe I organize the procedures steps so that you find easy to go through the recipe. I adapt the procedures to our appliances turning the oldest instructions to a modern way of cooking. I adapt the procedures and appliances also to fit the timing of recipes so they could be prepared in shortest time. 3 Step-by-Step Photo Instructions A picture is worth a thousand words I take pictures of every action that my hands do. I think that sometimes things seems difficult just because you have never seen them before. I take photo of every things that I do, so it is just like if you are in my kitchen while I’m cooking. You can check the recipe in progress and do it “with me”. High quality recipes Recipes are released only when they are perfect for my standards. This means three things: 1 Oversimplified recipes Recipes must be really feasible and friendly for a worldwide cooking. I’m very selective in this process. 2 Delicious flavor recipes Easy but delicious. I never miss flavor to ease a recipe. Piemonte recipes simplify my work, because they are easy enough to be oversimplified never missing great savor. 3 Mouth-watering photos recipes When a recipe is ready the scent in my house is amazing. If you were here… Right! I send you gorgeous pictures! 1 Recipe at a time Hastily done is ill done I want to provide surprisingly new delicious, healthy and easy recipes. I spend great time to do that. I love to see you happy cooking and tasting my new recipes.

Plansaround,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/plansaround,"They live in a generation where the use of social media is becoming too important for their lives. In addition to sharing information and content, social media have become very popular because they allow people to use the internet to establish personal or business relationships. It is said that social media serves to compensate for the lack of sociality of the modern and post-industrial era. But is it really possible to define ‘sociality’ an interaction or approach among individuals in a totally virtual way? Social living should be built on natural social interactions. They should go back to verbal confrontation, to communicate through words, looks, and try to avoid confrontation with other individuals just behind a computer screen or a smartphone. But if a person wants to organize a real activity involving other people using some popular social media, how can he organize it without first knowing these individuals? For those reasons It’s been developed a new platform to promote the return to classical social interactions and to get to know new people without the use of instant messaging, promoting the ‘face to face’ socializing instead of a virtual acquaintanceship, this innovative platform allows people to organize activities all over the world involving all its users, without having to personally know the participants in the activities, and without having to spend hours in front of a keyboard or a phone screen.",https://www.plansaround.com/,"Apps, Information Services, Information Technology","Catania, Sicilia, Italy",Plansaround promotes the return to classical social interactions and to get to know new people without the use of instant messaging.,"3,660,201",2018-01-01,year,1-10,,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,Closed,,,,none,For Profit,,https://www.facebook.com/Plansaround/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/plansaround/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Apps, Information Technology, Software",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Replacement-in-hearing,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/replacement-in-hearing,"We are launching in Italy and then we'll launch globally. We are looking for someone can help us paying (high) tax to build a society in Italy. If a lawyer is unable to attend a hearing or has another unavoidable commitment, he is forced to search through long lists and make numerous phone calls to find a colleague available to replace him, resulting in a considerable waste of time. Also the payment, often made in person, can create many problems. The purpose of Substitute Audience is to ensure that all this does not happen again. With Substitute Hearing, you just need to request a replacement by filling out the form and making the payment. Immediately, a matching algorithm will find the perfect replacement (it is not possible to entrust a divorce lawsuit to a lawyer specializing in economic law, for this reason we will make sure, depending on the description provided, that the requests are categorized in the right category) and will send him an email to ask for availability. Once the availability is confirmed, the person who requested the replacement can choose to refuse the replacement, or simply not to do anything and enjoy the time savings. Once the chosen replacement has sent all the documents attesting to his participation in the hearing and a summary of what has been said, he will be credited with the payment, less a commission for the operation of the service. There is also a ranking system that rewards substitutes with a higher vote and penalizes those with lower votes, to ensure an ever-increasing quality of service. In addition, we plan to add different categories of replacements soon and the possibility of requesting a replacement by phone via automatic service. The business is scalable in every country where lawyers are present. In the event that the replacement does not appear, a penalty will be applied and will be immediately removed from the service. To ensure an efficient and safe service, there is an emergency replacement system in the event that the replacement does not appear for any reason at the hearing scheduled 15 minutes before. The substitute lawyer is then required to send a message to the Replacement Hearing as confirmation of attendance.  In addition, there will be the possibility of subscribing to a subscription that includes a fixed number of possible substitutions, telephone substitutions and other benefits.",http://dev.sostitutodiudienza.it,"Consulting, Legal, Legal Tech, Subscription Service","Bari, Puglia, Italy",Simple Replacements for lawyers,"3,656,151",2017-12-01,day,1-10,,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",70132,,Closed,,,,none,For Profit,http://twitter.com/SUdienza,http://facebook.com/sostitutodiudienza,,info@sostitutodiudienza.it,+39 0808807674,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other, Professional Services",1,Domenico Traversa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SportAround shows exactly which are the closest or the best places broadcasting events of the most followed sports on TV. Therefore, fans can directly book a table in the chosen place, also inviting friends, or even ask them to vote for their favourite place in a poll. Their experiences with SportAround are also enhanced by two other in-app, live features: Facts, a live score feed to check the main sport actions and statistics in real time; and Yaks, a geolocalized chat to comment and exchange opinions during the match. Finally, we aim at building intangible values around the concept of “being fan”. That is why we introduced a gamification system with a full set of contextual actions to surprise users at first, and consequently engage and retain them. In order to gather the most precise, exhaustive and reliable information about sport broadcasts, we created SportAround Manager, a tool that we offer to our business customers: sport bars, pubs and restaurants. SportAround Manager allows them to: enefit of broadcast scheduling, simply choosing the sport events they want to show from a pre-set list; manage bookings real time and be alerted by push notifications; improve their traction by both showing their profile and services to a targeted audience, and advertising special offers in a Deal section; collect business statistics on user’s interaction; coverage and conversion of their profiles and their offers in an Insights section.",http://sportaround.me,"Location Based Services, Sports","Milan, Lombardia, Italy",Sport fan can find the closest or highest rated pubs that broadcast sports they want to watch and book a table.,"3,563,313",2015-01-24,day,1-10,,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",,,Closed,,,,none,For Profit,http://twitter.com/SportAround_me,http://www.facebook.com/Sportaroundme,http://www.linkedin.com/company/sportaround-me,info@sportaround.me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Navigation and Mapping, Sports",2,"Erik Capoccetta, Marco Moscatelli",,,,,,,,,,,,,Less than $1M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Startup Over,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/startup-over,"During these years I’ve read thousands of stories about start-ups from all over the world. I’ve noticed the growth of attention towards this phenomenon which has almost become a trend. When I launched my start-up in 2006, little was still known on technologies, difficulties and best practices in the field. At the time I would have probably made less mistakes if there had been all the information it is now available on this topic. Nowadays you can find so many forums and blogs with exhaustive answers and comments covering  every single aspect of how to set up and run a business. However, I noticed that nobody has ever dealt with whether these initiatives end in a positive or negative way. It is well-known that the mortality rate of start-ups is very high. Within the first three years of life only 1 out of 10 start-ups reaches the breakeven but… what about the other 9? What happens to them? Why didn’t they survive? What could they have done differently? What’s the perspective of those involved in the failure? That’s the goal of this blog: telling stories of those who didn’t make it and learn which lessons can be learnt.

Wami,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wami-srl,"Wami is a tech company that has been working in the travel industry since the end of 2012.  We offer a network of mobile guides that support travelers with a handy tool for smartphones and tablets to discover the best of a territory. The main focus of our guides is to enable a more genuine experience of the territory, providing travelers with everything they need to enjoy a city or a territory at its fullest - from local “pills of wisdom” about what to do and to see there to the access to services related to their staying, such as accommodation, dining, transportation, etc. Although travel is a crowded market, we feel that there is a big opportunity for us.  We’ve always been keen travelers and our experience taught us that when you’re planning a journey, you usually have a hard time trying to discern the trusted sources of information among the many options you have because of fake reviews, outdated information and poor suggestions.  That’s why we created Wami. Wami is like the local friend you would call for advice.  Our mobile guides combine up-to-date information of general interest coming from open data and social data with unique local tips. Content is taken from selected sources, validated and optimized: it features the main points of interest in the area and all the activities you can enjoy during the day and at night. Wami apps are free for the final users and boast state-of-the-art design, offline maps, offline content and a smart geolocated system called Amerigo, that can suggest you what to do according to your position, the time of the day and the weather conditions.  Also, users can count on geolocated services that are displayed in the exact moment they might need them. We take maximum care for the user experience, that we believe should be an outstanding travel experience, enabled and improved by technology. Wami is already on the market with 25 applications - native applications for iOS and Android devices and a HTML5 version that we developed as technical partners of local editors.  We’re currently switching to a new business model, though, where our philosophy is further enhanced and Wami has full control of the process. We are starting to profile our users and implementing a pay-per-person marketing strategy. The company is based in Treviso, Italy. We’re 6 people and 5 of us are software engineers. The founders, Enrico and Carlo, are both developers and they’ve been working together for over ten years. Carlo is currently in London, UK to explore the international opportunities for Wami. Our goal is to entirely cover Italy and to extend our reach to Europe and eventually overseas and we are looking for a seed investment to sustain both product development and business development.",http://www.wami.it,"Location Based Services, Software, Tourism, Travel","Farra Di Soligo, Veneto, Italy",Mobile travel guides to discover the gems of a territory from the point of view of locals.,"3,355,695",2012-11-01,day,1-10,,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",31010,,Closed,,,,none,For Profit,http://twitter.com/wamiguides,http://www.facebook.com/wamiguides,http://www.linkedin.com/company/wami-srl,info@wami.it,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data and Analytics, Internet Services, Navigation and Mapping, Software, Travel and Tourism",2,"Carlo Schiesaro, Enrico Piovesan",2,Seed,2013-01-01,70000,USD,70000,Seed,,,,,,$1M to $10M,,,,,,,70000,USD,70000,Seed,120000,USD,120000,120000,USD,120000,,,

Five years ago, Fabrizio hooked Pancrazio Auteri, co-founder and our leading video and IT guru, and together they began assembling the team, standing now at about 30 mostly engineers, that continue to make the TVBLOB vision a reality. TVBLOB offers solutions for both professional video streaming and consumer ""over-the-top"" Internet TV, the latter of which is our primary focus now.",http://www.tvblob.com,"Broadcasting, Information Technology, Internet, Robotics, Software, Video","Milan, Lombardia, Italy",Software Development ConnectedTV,"3,550,126",2003-01-01,year,11-50,,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",20131,,Closed,,,,none,For Profit,http://twitter.com/tvblob,https://www.facebook.com/blobbox,,info@tvblob.com,39 02 36 56 24 40,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hardware, Information Technology, Internet Services, Media and Entertainment, Science and Engineering, Software, Video",1,Fabrizio Caffarelli,,,,,,,,,,,,,$1M to $10M,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
